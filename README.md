# synthesizer

This is a project on my live coding stream [Codebase Alpha](https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha) starting with episode 34. The aim of the project is to explore some of the features of the extensive the **NAudio** digital audio library. To do this, I'm using **.NET Core 3.0** and **WPF** to develop a simple sythesizer, starting with a monophonic keyboard, but going on throughout the project to introduce such things as polyphony, ADSR envelopes, instruments and voices, and visualisations (such as a spectrum analyser). Basically, let's see how far we can take this!

Please note that, despite this being a .NET Core project, because I'm using **NAudio** and **WPF**, this code is Windows-only at this time.

The NAudio Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).
