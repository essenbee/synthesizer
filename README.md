This is a project on my live coding stream [Codebase Alpha](https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha) starting with episode 34. The aim of the project is to explore some of the features of the extensive the **NAudio** digital audio library. To do this, I'm using **.NET Core 3.0** and **WPF** to develop a simple synthesizer, starting with a monophonic keyboard, but going on throughout the project to introduce such things as polyphony, ADSR envelopes, instruments and voices, and visualisations (such as a spectrum analyser). Basically, let's see how far we can take this!

Please note that, despite this being a .NET Core project, because I'm using **NAudio** and **WPF**, this code is Windows-only at this time.

The NAudio Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).

## Progress

#### Episode 34

A simple monophonic synthesizer was created. The code needs tidying up but its working at a basic level. Next up: add polyphony anf the ability to change the octave the keyboard covers!

#### Episode 35

Added a GUI octave selector and had initial stab at making the keyboard polyphonic. Merged a PR that added a T4 template to generate the view model.

#### Episode 36

Merged a PR that added a spectrum analyser and waveform visualizer to the GUI. Moved from wavetables to signal generators in the `SynthWaveProvider` class, and implemented ADSR envelopes to shape the sound profile of notes. Finally, created a low pass filter and a tremolo effect for the synthesizer. The GUI elements of these latter were left for another stream.
