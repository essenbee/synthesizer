# synthesizer

This is a project on my live coding stream [Codebase Alpha](https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha) starting with episode 34. The aim of the project is to explore some of the features of the extensive the NAudio digital audio library. To do this, I'm using .NET Core 3.0 and WPF to develop a simple sythesizer, starting with a monophonic keyboard, but going on throughout the project to introduce such things as polyphony, ADSR envelopes, instruments and voices, and visualisations (such as a spectrum analyser). Basically, let's see how far we can take this!
